    "TFDV Exercise\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, you will get to practice using [TensorFlow Data Validation (TFDV)](https://cloud.google.com/solutions/machine-learning/analyzing-and-validating-data-at-scale-for-ml-using-tfx), an open-source Python package from the [TensorFlow Extended (TFX)](https://www.tensorflow.org/tfx) ecosystem. \n",
    "\n",
    "TFDV helps to understand, validate, and monitor production machine learning data at scale. It provides insight into some key questions in the data analysis process such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "* What are the underlying statistics of my data?\n",
    "\n",
    "* What does my training dataset look like?\n",
    "\n",
    "* How does my evaluation and serving datasets compare to the training dataset?\n",
    "\n",
    "* How can I find and fix data anomalies?\n",
    "\n",
    "The figure below summarizes the usual TFDV workflow:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src='img/tfdv.png' alt='picture of tfdv workflow'>\n",
    "\n",
    "As shown, you can use TFDV to compute descriptive statistics of the training data and generate a schema. You can then validate new datasets (e.g. the serving dataset from your customers) against this schema to detect and fix anomalies. This helps prevent the different types of skew. That way, you can be confident that your model is training on or predicting data that is consistent with the expected feature types and distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "This ungraded exercise demonstrates useful functions of TFDV at an introductory level as preparation for this week's graded programming exercise. Specifically, you will:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Generate and visualize statistics from a dataset**\n",
    "- **Detect and fix anomalies in an evaluation dataset**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Computing and Visualizing Descriptive Statistics\n",
    "\n",
    "At the basis of TFDV lies a powerful library to compute descriptive statistics over your ML data. These statistics are used to both help developers investigate and understand their data, as well as infer a schema (more on this later).\n",
    "\n",
    "The TFDV APIs are designed to enable connectors to different data formats, and to provide flexibility and scale.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Connectors**: TFDV uses __Apache Beam__ to define and process its data pipelines. As a result, existing __Beam IO connectors__, as well as user-defined __PTransforms__, can be used to process different formats and representations of data. We provide two helper functions for CSV and TF Record of serialized tf.Examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### compute statistics for a CSV file\n",
    "train_stats = tfdv.generate_statistics_from_csv(TRAIN_DATA)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### compute statistics for TF Record files\n",
    "train_stats = tfdv.generate_statistics_from_tfrecord(TRAIN_DATA)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Flexibility**: The API also allows for the computation of __custom statistics__ (in addition to the standard statistics computed by TFDV), so long as this computation can be expressed as __Apache Beam transformations__. These custom statistics are serialized in the same statistics.proto and can be consumed by downstream libraries.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Scale**: TFDV creates an Apache Beam pipeline that is executed with a __DirectRunner__ in the notebook environment. The same pipeline can be distributed with other runners, e.g. with the __DataflowRunner__ on Google Cloud Platform. The Apache Flink and Apache Beam communities are also nearing completion of a Flink Runner. \n",
    "The statistics are stored in a statistics.proto and can be visualized from within the notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's begin!"

    "Next step is to create a data schema to describe your train set. Simply put, a schema describes standard characteristics of your data such as column data types and expected data value range. The schema is created on a dataset that you consider as reference, and can be reused to validate other incoming datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "With the computed statistics, TFDV allows you to automatically generate an initial version of the schema using the [`infer_schema()`](https://www.tensorflow.org/tfx/data_validation/api_docs/python/tfdv/infer_schema) method. This returns a Schema [protocol buffer](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers) containing the result. As mentioned in the [TFX paper](http://stevenwhang.com/tfx_paper.pdf) (Section 3.3), the results of the schema inference can be summarized as follows:\n",

    "* The expected type of each feature.\n",
    "* The expected presence of each feature, in terms of a minimum count and fraction of examples that must contain\n",

    "* The expected valency of the feature in each example, i.e.,\n",
    "minimum and maximum number of values.\n",
    "* The expected domain of a feature, i.e., the small universe of\n",
    "values for a string feature, or range for an integer feature.\n",

We know that those values do not make sense if we're talking about working adults.

As expected, there are string values for `race`, `native-country` and `occupation` that are not found in the domain of the training set schema (you might see a different result if the shuffling of the datasets was applied). What you decide to do about the anomalies depend on your domain knowledge of the data. If an anomaly indicates a data error, then the underlying data should be fixed. Otherwise, you can update the schema to include the values in the evaluation dataset.\n",

    "We encourage you to go back to the beginning of this section and try different slices. Here are other ways you can explore:\n",
    "\n",
    "* If you want to be more specific, then you can map the specific value to the feature name. For example, if you want just `Male`, then you can declare it as `features={'sex': [b'Male']}`. Notice that the string literal needs to be passed in as bytes with the `b'` prefix.\n",

    "* You can also pass in several features if you want. For example, if you want to slice through both the `sex` and `race` features, then you can do `features={'sex': None, 'race': None}`.\n",

    "You might find it cumbersome or inefficient to redo the whole process for a particular slice. For that, you can make helper functions to streamline the type conversions and you will see one implementation in this week's assignment."
