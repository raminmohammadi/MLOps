    "[Tensorflow Data Validation (TFDV)](https://cloud.google.com/solutions/machine-learning/analyzing-and-validating-data-at-scale-for-ml-using-tfx) is an open-source library that helps to understand, validate, and monitor production machine learning (ML) data at scale. Common use-cases include comparing training, evaluation and serving datasets, as well as checking for training/serving skew. You have seen the core functionalities of this package in the previous ungraded lab and you will get to practice them in this week's assignment.\n",
